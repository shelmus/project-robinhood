## AI Coordination Protocol
- AI assistants tag logs with their origin: `MemoryUnit_A`, `MemoryUnit_B`.
- Shared design decisions must be marked under `Consensus:`.
- Conflicting logic paths require a `MergeRequest:` entry.
- Synchronization is validated via the `project.meta.json` timestamp and hash.

## File Index & Integrity Anchors
- GPIO pin mappings
- Sensor configuration
- Scoring logic
- Display interface
- Hardware test logs

## Milestones
- [ ] GPIO wiring confirmed
- [ ] Switch detection logic functional
- [ ] Score system implemented
- [ ] Enclosure designed and fabricated

## Interaction Logbook
All intents, deviations, and AI-generated outputs are recorded here for continuity and recovery.
